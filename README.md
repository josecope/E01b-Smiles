# E01b-Smiles
This exercise was a fun challenge.  Throughout the various main.pys, I reconstructed and moved the different parts of a smiley face, including the eyes, outline, yellow circle, smile, and pupils.

In main1.py, the parts of the smiley face were all in the bottom left corner of the window.  In order to reconstruct the face in the center of the window, I repeatedly changed the x and y coordinates of the different parts and tested the coordinates in the terminal each time.  Once I got used to moving things around, it was easy to focus on getting the small details (such as pupil placement) correct.

Main2.py followed the same structure as main1.py.  The difference with this step was that the formatting of the coordinates was different.

In main3.py, the objective was the same but, again, had different formatting.  This time, I had to adjust the x and y values while they were modified by addition and subtraction signs.

Main4.py was different.  The formatting was the same as in main3.py, but there was several different faces overlapping each other.  It was interesting that by only editing the coordinates in one section, I was able to move the parts of the face on each individual face.
